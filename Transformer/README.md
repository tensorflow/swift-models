# Transformer

This is an implementation of [OpenAI's GPT-2 Transformer language model](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) using [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift).

In order to run this code, first download a pre-trained checkpoint from OpenAI
using the included `download_model.sh` script. Script needs one parameter - model name.

```sh
bash download_model.sh 117M
```

Then, compile using `swiftc`:

```sh
swiftc -O -ltensorflow -o main Operators.swift Model.swift PythonCheckpointReader.swift main.swift
```

You can now sample from the model either unconditionally:

```sh
./main [temperature]
```

or conditionally:

```sh
./main [temperature] "conditioning text"
```

In either case, a "temperature" of 0 means "always output the same text, but it'll be fairly boring,"
a temperature of 1 means sampling exactly according to the model probabilities, and a temperature
higher than 1 means sampling more randomly than the model probabilities indicate. Values of 0.5-0.8 tend
to be best.

Here's one output we got:

```sh

Introducing Swift for TensorFlow

Swift has been around since the beginning. It was created by the Swift team to enable developers to write Swift code. It is a powerful language for developing many different types of data structures.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Swift to write a simple, simple TensorFlow program.
```

This code requires a Swift for TensorFlow toolchain.
To get a toolchain, you can:

1. [Download a pre-built package](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md).
2. [Compile a toolchain from source](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/tensorflow#building-swift-for-tensorflow).

It also currently requires Python 3.x.

Both the tokenizer (`encoder.py`) and the model download script (`download_model.sh`) are
from the OpenAI implementation and are licensed under MIT.
