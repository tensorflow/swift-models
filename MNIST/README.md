# MNIST

This directory builds a two-layer perceptron to classify the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Setup

To begin, you'll need the [latest version of Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) installed.
Make sure you've added the correct version of `swift` to your path.

To train the model, run:

```
swift -O MNIST.swift
```
