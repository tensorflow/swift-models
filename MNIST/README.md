# MNIST

This directory builds a simple convolutional neural network to classify the
[MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Setup

To begin, you'll need the [latest version of Swift for
TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md)
installed. Make sure you've added the correct version of `swift` to your path.

To train the model, run:

```
cd swift-models
swift run -c release MNIST
```
