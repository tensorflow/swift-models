# Swift for TensorFlow Models

This repository contains TensorFlow models written in Swift.

The `stable` branch works with the latest [Swift for TensorFlow releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases).

Actual development occurs on the `master` branch.
As new packages are released, `master` is pushed to `stable`.

For general information about Swift for TensorFlow development, please visit
[tensorflow/swift](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift).


## macOS Troubleshooting
If you see `TensorFlow not found` when building samples from command line or 
```shell
<unknown>:0: error: cannot load underlying module for 'Darwin'
<unknown>:0: note: did you forget to set an SDK using -sdk or SDKROOT?
<unknown>:0: note: use "xcrun swiftc" to select the default macOS SDK installed with Xcode
  ```
make sure you've added the correct version of `swift` to your path.
eg. 
```shell
which swift
/usr/bin/swift # This is the wrong path!
```
The swift binary should be referencing the most updated toolchain bin path eg. 
```shell
export PATH="/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest/usr/bin/:$PATH"
which swift
/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest/usr/bin/swift
```
