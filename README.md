# Swift for TensorFlow Models

This repository contains TensorFlow models written in Swift.

Use the ```tensorflow-xx``` branch that corresponds to the release you are using from [Swift for TensorFlow releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases).  For example, for the 0.6 release, use the ```tensorflow-0.6``` branch.

Actual development occurs on the `master` branch.
As new packages are released, `master` is pushed to `stable`.

For general information about Swift for TensorFlow development, please visit
[tensorflow/swift](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift).

## Development

### macOS and Linux

Use Swift Package Manager to develop Swift for TensorFlow models.

#### Build

```bash
swift build
```

#### Test

```bash
swift test
```

### Windows

Use CMake to develop Swift for TensorFlow models.

### *Experimental* CMake Support

There is experimental support for building with CMake.  This is required to build the models on Windows, and can also be used to cross-compile the models and the demo programs.

**NOTE**: tests are currently not supported with the CMake based build.

It is highly recommended that you use CMake 3.16 or newer to ensure that `-B`
and parallel builds function properly in the example commands below. To install
this version on Ubuntu, we recommend following the instructions at
[Kitware's apt repo](https://apt.kitware.com/).

**Prerequisite:** [Ninja build tool](https://ninja-build.org/). Find
installation commands for your favorite package manager
[here](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages).

macOS:

```
# Configure

  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                                      \
  -D CMAKE_Swift_COMPILER=$(TOOLCHAINS=tensorflow xcrun -f swiftc) \
  -G Ninja                                                         \
