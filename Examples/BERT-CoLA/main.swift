// Regarding the batch size, note that the way batching is performed currently is that we bucket
// input sequences based on their length (e.g., first bucket contains sequences of length 1 to 10,
// second 11 to 20, etc.). We then keep processing examples in the input data pipeline until a
// bucket contains enough sequences to form a batch. The batch size specified in the task
// constructor specifies the *total number of tokens in the batch* and not the total number of
// sequences. So, if the batch size is set to 1024, the first bucket (i.e., lengths 1 to 10)
// will need 1024 / 10 = 102 examples to form a batch (every sentence in the bucket is padded
// to the max length of the bucket). This kind of bucketing is common practice with NLP models and
// it is done to improve memory usage and computational efficiency when dealing with sequences of
// varied lengths. Note that this is not used in the original BERT implementation released by
// Google and so the batch size setting here is expected to differ from that one.
