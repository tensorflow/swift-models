// MARK: Solution of shallow water equation

/// Differentiable solution of shallow water equation on a unit square.
///
/// Shallow water equation is a type of hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE). This struct
/// represents its solution calculated with finite-difference discretization on a 2D plane and at a
/// particular point in time.
///
/// More details about the shallow water PDE can found for example on
/// [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations)
///
/// # Domain and Discretization
/// The PDE is solved on a `<0,1>x<0,1>` square discretized with spatial step of size `Δx`.
/// Laplace operator is approximated with five-point stencil finite-differencing.
///
/// Temporal advancing uses semi implicit Euler's schema. Time step `Δt` is calculated from
/// `Δx` to stay below the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy numerical stability limit.
///
/// # Boundary Conditions
/// Values around the edges of the domain are subject to trivial Dirichlet boundary conditions
/// (i.e. equal to 0 with an arbitrary gradient).
///
/// # Laplace Operator Δ
/// Discretization of the operator is implemented as convolution with a fixed 3x3 kernel. The
/// weights of the kernel are set in such a way so it matches the five-point stencil finite-difference
/// schema.
///
/// - Bug:
///  Result of applying Laplacian to the water height at a particular time-step is needlessly
///  (due to my laziness ;) calculated twice. When the time advances `u1` becomes `u0` of
///  the following time step. The result of applying the Laplace operator to `u1` can be cached
///  and reused a step later.
///
